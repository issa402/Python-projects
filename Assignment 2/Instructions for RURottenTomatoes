Write a Python program to determine the best-rated movie out of a list of movies and their ratings by multiple reviewers.
The program should prompt the user to enter the number of movies and the number of reviewers.
Then, the program should ask the user to input the ratings for each movie by each reviewer.
After receiving the ratings, the program should calculate the total rating for each movie.
Finally, the program should determine and print the index of the movie with the highest total rating.
