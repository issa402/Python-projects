Create a Python program that calculates the wind chill factor based on the temperature and wind velocity provided as command-line arguments.
Inside the main() function, check if the correct number of command-line arguments (two) is provided. If not, print an error message instructing the user to provide two arguments (temperature and velocity), and then exit the program.
Attempt to parse the command-line arguments as floating-point numbers, representing the temperature and velocity values. 
Check if the temperature and velocity values are within the valid range specified in the problem statement. 
If the input values are valid, compute the wind chill factor using the provided formula: wind_chill = 35.74 + 0.6215 * temperature + (0.4275 * temperature - 35.75) * pow(velocity, 0.16).
The program should be executable from the command line by providing two arguments representing the temperature and velocity values, respectively.
